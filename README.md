## Getting Started

To begin exploring brand names and checking domain availability, follow these steps:

1. **Choose Your Approach**: 
   - **Generative AI Model**: Select a generative AI model, such as GPT-4 or Mistral, to generate brand names.
   - **Custom Brand Names**: Alternatively, choose to input your own list of brand names.

2. **Select a Topic**: If using a generative AI model, select a topic. This topic will be used to generate relevant keywords and brand name suggestions.

3. **Domain Availability Check**: 
   - For brand names generated by the AI, the app will automatically check domain availability using the GoDaddy API and provide a list of available domains.
   - If you're inputting your own brand names, write a list of names, separating each name with a comma. The app will then check the availability of these custom names.
